I'm an M.S. student in the [Computer Engineering Department](https://w3.cs.bilkent.edu.tr) at [Bilkent University](https://w3.bilkent.edu.tr/bilkent/), studying, Robot Learning, Manipulation, Task and Motion Planning (TAMP) and Contact-Rich Manipulation. My advisor is [Dr. Ozgur S. Oguz](https://oz-oguz.github.io), and I'm a member of the [Bilkent Learning for Intelligent Robot Assistants Lab (LIRA)](https://bilkent-lira.github.io). My research interests are TAMP problems in contact-rich environments and robot learning.

I obtained my B.S. from the [Mechanical Engineering Department at Bilkent University](https://me.bilkent.edu.tr/), majoring in mechanical engineering, with an emphasis on robotics.

For a comprehensive overview of my professional journey, please refer to my [CV](assets/pdf/cicek_cv.pdf).
