I recently completed my M.S. in Computer Engineering at [Bilkent University](https://w3.bilkent.edu.tr/bilkent/), where I focused on **Robot Learning**, **Vision-Language-Action Models**, and **Contact-Rich Manipulation**. I was fortunate to be advised by [Dr. Ozgur S. Oguz](https://oz-oguz.github.io) at the [Bilkent Learning for Intelligent Robot Assistants Lab (LIRA)](https://bilkent-lira.github.io).

My research bridges **foundation models** and **embodied AI**, with a particular focus on enabling robots to perform complex, contact-rich manipulation tasks through neuro-symbolic reasoning. My master's thesis, [*Contact-VLA*](https://repository.bilkent.edu.tr/items/8206bc1f-a473-45bb-8952-50deb4b3f659), introduces **CoRAL** (Contact-Rich Adaptive LLM-based Control)—a framework that leverages Large Language Models as adaptive world model designers and cost function synthesizers for model predictive control, achieving robust zero-shot manipulation on novel tasks.

My work has been published in venues including **IEEE RA-L** (with presentation at **ICRA 2026**) and **ACS Photonics**, with additional papers under review at **RSS 2026**. I'm passionate about developing AI systems that can reason about physical interactions, adapt to uncertainties, and generalize across diverse manipulation scenarios.

I obtained my B.S. in Mechanical Engineering from Bilkent University, where I developed a strong foundation in dynamics, control, and computational modeling that complements my work in robot learning.

Currently, I'm a Data Scientist at [Trendyol](https://www.trendyol.com) developing AI-powered search algorithms, while continuing research collaborations at [LIRA Lab](https://bilkent-lira.github.io). I'm also actively developing [**PuzzleWorld-3D**](https://www.puzzleworld-3d.com), an API-based benchmark for evaluating embodied AI agents.
